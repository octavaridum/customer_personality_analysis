<h1 align="center">Customer Personality Analysis</h1> 

![Intro Img](Image/cus_per_ana.png)

## Background ‚ùì
Customer personality analysis is an essential aspect of modern marketing and business strategy. Understanding the personality traits and behaviors of customers can help businesses tailor their marketing efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and increase sales. By leveraging data-driven approaches, companies can segment their customer base into distinct groups with similar characteristics. This segmentation allows for more personalized and effective marketing strategies, ultimately leading to better customer engagement and loyalty.

## Problem Statement üö®
Despite the availability of vast amounts of customer data, many businesses struggle to effectively analyze and utilize this information to understand their customers' personalities. Traditional methods of customer segmentation often fall short in capturing the nuanced behaviors and preferences of customers. This lack of detailed insight hinders the ability of businesses to deliver personalized experiences, resulting in missed opportunities for customer retention and revenue growth.

## Objective üéØ
The primary objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive clustering analysis to segment customers based on their personality traits and behaviors. By leveraging clustering techniques, we aim to identify distinct customer personas that can be used to tailor marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement.

## Solution üí°
This is an unsupervised learning clustering problem, where the goal is to segment the customer base into distinct groups. We will employ various machine learning clustering techniques, including K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN, and K-Medoids Clustering, to create these segments. We will evaluate the performance of these clustering models using metrics such as the Silhouette Score. The process will begin with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain a deeper understanding of our dataset, followed by the application of the clustering algorithms. After comparing the clustering results based on the evaluation metrics, we will select the best-performing model for deployment. This approach will enable us to accurately identify and group customers personality, facilitating more targeted marketing strategies and personalized services to optimize sales and enhance customer satisfaction.

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis üíæ

I have obtained the data set and now it is time to perform an Exploratory data Analysis (EDA) to gain insight about the dataset and prepare the data for modeling purposes.

**1.1 Dataset**
The dataset is the historical sales data that contains sales from 2010-12-01 to 2011-12-09 which is a total of 699 days. It has 29 features and 2,240 observations. The following are a short information of our feature:
